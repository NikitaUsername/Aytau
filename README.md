# Website, CRM and server for hotel
This is the [demo booking page](https://nikitausername.github.io/Hotel/#/booking)

## This project consists of three parts:
### Hotel website
 Users can send booking request for the apartments and confirm the reservation after receiving the link
### CRM
  Administrators can confirm booking and send a link to users to confirm their reservation
### Server
  Works for both of the clients, uses JWT-auth for administrators
